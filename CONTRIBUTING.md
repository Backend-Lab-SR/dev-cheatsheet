# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but this repository intentionally keeps a high signal-to-noise ratio.

The goal is to provide concise, practical command references for experienced software engineers.

## Guidelines

- Follow the conventions defined in `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Focus on commands used in real-world, day-to-day development
- Prefer fewer high-value commands over exhaustive lists
- Avoid beginner tutorials and conceptual explanations
- Test commands where possible

## Adding or Updating Cheatsheets

- Place cheatsheets under the `cheatsheets/` directory
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- One technology per file
- Update `README.md` when adding a new cheatsheet

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes focused and well-scoped
- Include a brief description of what changed and why
- Large or opinionated changes should be discussed in an issue first
