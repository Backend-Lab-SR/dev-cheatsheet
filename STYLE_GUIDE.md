# Style Guide

This repository contains practical command cheatsheets for experienced software engineers.

The goal is to provide fast, high-signal references for real-world development—not tutorials or learning material.

## Principles
- Commands over explanations
- Optimize for speed and skimmability
- Prefer real-world, production usage
- Fewer high-value commands are better than exhaustive lists

## Structure
- All cheatsheets live under `cheatsheets/`
- One technology per file
- Use clear section headers to group related commands

## Content Guidelines
- Assume the reader already knows the technology
- Avoid beginner tutorials and conceptual explanations
- Include debugging, inspection, and recovery commands
- Comments and descriptions should be minimal or omitted

## Formatting
- Use markdown
- Use fenced code blocks for commands
- Keep text concise and consistent

## Non-Goals
- Teaching fundamentals
- Explaining how tools work
- Covering every possible command
